# Analysis

## Program A 

The first program was fairly simple in its implementation.  In order to achieve the desired response, a new value would be placed into the accumulator and then stored in a position in the memory.  This was done by using the LDAI and STA commands.  The first value would be loaded into the accumulator by using the LDAI command.  Once the value was in the accumulator, it was stored at a desired position in the memory by linking the two locations by using the same label name.  In order to prevent the program from continuing beyond what's necessary, an infinite loop was created at the end of the program.
